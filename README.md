# 4D-Chess

A multiplayer web browser game of 4-dimensional chess and a server to run it.

## Introduction

The original inspiration for this game is from [this video](https://youtu.be/3wFQPSEPgWc). It also explains how the 4d chess rules work.   
It's written to work in a Chrome browser, but should also work in Firefox.   
The game currently runs on http://chess.sosehl.cz

## More info
